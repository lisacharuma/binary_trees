This is the readme file for the binary trees project. Binary trees are non-linear data structures implemented using structures and pointers.

Below is what will be focused on in this project-:

What is a binary tree
What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
